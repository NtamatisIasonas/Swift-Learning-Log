## Third Day's notes:

## Log-1:

Back at it with another unprofessional note, OpenGL has been quite the eye opening experience to how crazy the graphical world is. So far coding blindly with some text on the screen or using a game engine like unity have kept me safe, but that changed these past couple of days as i decided to try out this insane topic in the coding world. Indeed a crazy matter as today I only managed to make a triangle and that I'm too proud for what it actually is. Progress is being made I am waiting on uni assignments to cool down so that i can focus more on this rather interesting but insanely difficult task.

## Useful Theory

Today was also a no theory day, OpenGL really has been quite the new thing for me and it is definetly posing a major issue in terms of understanding what I'm doing. With time I am sure I will figure it out but for a first project it was indeed too much.

## Important Note

Keep in mind I am using VS Code on Ubuntu 24.04 to write my scripts so things may not be perfect or even functional.
As of right now switching to macOS on an apple device is my main goal so until then please be patient for any errors you may encounter.
