## First Day's notes:

---

## Log-1:

I have started with some basic swift learning and made a simple script to check out how variables behave in swift and an if statement which I have simplified using a descriptive boolean in order to clean up the code.

I am following that script up with a basic swiftUI script to visualise a bit of what the finance tracker app will look like, or at least an initial inspiration, in order to learn a bit more about app development.

## Log-2:

Picking up where I left of with some of the basic swift material I decided to also check out some functions since they did have a somewhat different structure than what I am used to in C# for example. Still pretty managable

To finish off for today some quick class studies were done with a very simple script using a function as well for further testing

## Useful Theory

Functions are self-contained chunks of code that perform a specific task. You can call a functions via it's name and perform it's task when needed.
Every function in swift has a type, consisting of the function's parameter types and return type. As a result we can use this type in other functions as parameters to them and to return functions from functions. Functions can be nested.

Classes can
- Define properties to store values
- Define methods to provide functionality
- Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
- Define initializers to set up their initial state
- Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
- Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind
- Inheritance enables one class to inherit characteristics of another
- Type casting enables one class to inherit the type of a class instance at runtime
- Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance

## Important Note

Keep in mind I am using VS Code on Ubuntu 24.04 to write my scripts so things may not be perfect or even functional.
As of right now switching to macOS on an apple device is my main goal so until then please be patient for any errors you may encounter.
